## Game Instructions

1. **Objective:**
   The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a total of 100 points.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Two players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
   - On your turn, roll the die and accumulate points based on the number rolled.
   - If you roll a number from 2 to 6, you have two options:
     - **Roll Again:** Choose to roll the die again to add the newly rolled points to your current turn's total.
     - **Hold:** Decide to hold and add your current turn's points to your overall score. It will then be the other player's turn.
   - If you roll a 1, your current turn's points are lost, and it becomes the other player's turn immediately.

3. **Strategic Choices:**
   - The decision to hold or roll again is crucial. You need to balance the risk and reward.
   - Rolling again gives you a chance to accumulate more points but also carries the risk of rolling a 1 and losing all your turn's points.
   - Holding ensures that your current turn's points are added to your total score but leaves the remaining points for your opponent to potentially grab.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   The player who reaches a total of 100 points first is declared the winner. Keep a close eye on your opponent's score and strategize accordingly.

Remember, luck and decision-making skills are key in the game! Are you ready to take on the challenge and emerge victorious?
